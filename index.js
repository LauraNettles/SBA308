// You will create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. This is a very typical situation in industry, and this particular scenario has been modified from a real application. The data you will use is provided below.
// You will be provided with four different types of data:

// A CourseInfo object, which looks like this:
// {
//   "id": number,
//   "name": string,
// }
